# A Susy Layout Example

Susy is an awesome and light layout engine written in SASS. It gives you totally flexible column layouts.
Bye, bye large bloated frameworks! This is a solution you can scale with.

You will need a sass compiler to build the project's css.
I use Wellington:
https://github.com/wellington/wellington
Use a line similar to the below.
```
  wt compile -proj $ProjectFileDir$/sass -b $ProjectFileDir$/css
```
  
Here's a decent tutorial on Susy:

This is a tool well worth learning if you do any front-end web development. I highly recommend susy.
